### About
This project is a continuation of the assignments given during the course (assignment 2 and assignment 4). The project introduces three new features to the application:  
1. The ability to search for registered users.  
2. View a registered user’s “profile”.  
3. Additional information about the user:
  * Add and edit information about the user.
  * Additional information can be added during registration.

The registration process has been modified, and instead of only having the user submit a username and password, he or she can also add information about name and contact, however this is not mandatory and can be edited after registration as well.
